# rSCANNER
This is a vulnerability scanner that intergrated other famous tools

Companies are increasingly digitizing their business operations and processes, leading to
increase security risks. One of the major risks is a hacker exploiting a vulnerability that exists
within an organization&#39;s IT infrastructure. To mitigate the risk of a security incident, companies
need to be able to prevent, detect, respond and recover from such attacks. This has created space
for developing an automated vulnerability scanner that can detect all the possible vulnerabilities
and misconfigurations that can be exploited by unauthorized people and search for possible paths
to compromise systems.

# General Objective
To develop an automated vulnerability scanner to detect and report the vulnerabilities in both
web based and network systems
